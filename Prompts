DPI Capstone #1

SECTION 01 — Target Audience & Use-Case Context

GoTicket serves two distinct user groups operating on the same platform. Design must speak fluently to both without diluting either experience.

Audience A — Primary
Event Attendees

Urban professionals aged 22–40, mobile-first

Browse, discover & book events in under 60 seconds

Highly sensitive to confusing seat availability UI

Expects Eventbrite-level polish, wants speed

Context: stressed, in-the-moment, competitive booking

Audience B — Secondary
Event Organizers

Community leads, indie creators, DevRel managers

Need a dashboard to create, manage & monitor events

Care about registrant lists, capacity alerts, waitlist clarity

B2B mindset: efficiency, trust, data visibility

Context: busy, managing multiple events simultaneously

Use Case 01 — Competitive Last-Seat Booking

User sees a sold-out-risk event, races to register.
UI must communicate capacity live, confirm instantly, and surface waitlist position with zero ambiguity.

Use Case 02 — Organizer Event Dashboard

Organizer views live headcount, downloads registrant CSV, cancels an attendee, and monitors waitlist — all without leaving a single screen.

Use Case 03 — Admin Oversight Panel

Platform admin overrides stuck bookings, deactivates bad-actor accounts, and views system-level stats — utility-first, zero decorative noise.

SECTION 02 — Design Goals & Constraints

Every creative decision must be defensible against these hard guardrails. Beauty without performance is a bug.

Design Goals

Communicate seat availability and urgency without anxiety-inducing dark patterns

Build trust through transactional clarity (booking = explicit, unambiguous)

Create a brand identity that feels editorial + credible, not carnival-ticket tacky

Organizer dashboard should feel like a premium analytics tool — not an afterthought

Zero-confusion waitlist UI: user always knows exactly where they stand

Closing Principle

You're building a web application with a Go backend and Supabase as your database/auth/service layer. Provide a concrete plan to add user registration, including both backend (Go) and Supabase integration. Assume:- Backend: Go with a minimal REST API- Auth/Users: Use Supabase for authentication and user data storage- Endpoints to implement (at least):  1) POST /register to create a new user with email/password (and optional username)- Supabase integration: use the Go client to sign up users, login, and fetch user profiles; handle token exchange/validation- Security: input validation, rate limiting (basic), HTTPS, error handling- Environment: read Supabase URL and API key from environment variables; expose minimal config for local development- Error handling: clear messages without exposing secrets- Deliverables:   - Project structure with main.go, router, and a Supabase client initialization  - Handlers for register, login, and profile  - Instructions to run locally (env vars, go mod init, build/run)- Constraints: implement with standard library plus the official Supabase Go client or REST calls if no client exists- Optional: unit tests or basic integration tests if feasibless
